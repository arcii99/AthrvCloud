// Step 1: define the requirements of the tool
// For example, we need to recover text files from a HDFS file system.

// Step 2: choose the appropriate distributed computing tools and technologies
// We can use Hadoop and HDFS to distribute the data recovery process.
// We need to define the necessary configuration properties for Hadoop and HDFS.

// Step 3: break the data recovery process into smaller chunks and distribute them
// We can use Hadoop's MapReduce framework to divide the data recovery process.
// We need to define our own Map and Reduce functions for the recovery process.

// Step 4: implement a fault-tolerance mechanism
// We need to handle possible failures of nodes and networks, as well as data corruption issues.
// We can use Hadoop's built-in fault-tolerance mechanisms, such as job tracking and task retry.

// Step 5: implement data aggregation and analysis mechanisms
// We need to process the recovered data and present it to the user.
// We can use Hadoop's HDFS APIs to access and manipulate the recovered files.
