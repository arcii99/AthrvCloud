It will be obvious that any details which would help the reader to exactly identify the college or the criminal would be injudicious and offensive. So painful a scandal may well be allowed to die out. With due discretion, however, it might be communicated to the proper authorities, and smoked out, so to speak, for the benefit of the world.";
