======================================================
Welcome to the C Data recovery tool program!
======================================================
This program allows users to recover lost or accidentally
deleted files from their storage devices.

The program first prompts the user to enter the path to the
device where the lost file was originally located.
Once the path is provided, the program scans the device for
deleted files and presents a list of recoverable files to the user.

The user can then select the file they wish to recover from the list.
The program then copies the recovered data to a new file with the
original name and extension, along with the current date and time stamp.
