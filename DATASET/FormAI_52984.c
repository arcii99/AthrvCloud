/* 'Tis a tale of fair Capulet and her lover Montague
Whose code shall bring forth an image classifier to view
With love and precision they worked side by side 
To create a program with accuracy as their guide

With haste they began, declaring variables with care
And filling them with images, both here and there
Their eyes were fixed upon a goal so grand
To create a program that could classify any brand

They wrote code to normalize the images with ease
And algorithms to determine the features with breeze
With SVMs and decision trees to guide the way
No classification problem was too tough to slay

As they tested their program, they could not contain
The joy and excitement that bubbled like champagne
For their program did indeed classify with glory
Images of cats, dogs, cars, and stories

And so, dear friend, we bid thee adieu
May this code bring forth greatness from all you do
For as Capulet and Montague have shown
Love and determination can help you win the throne */
