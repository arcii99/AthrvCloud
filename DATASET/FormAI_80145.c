// Welcome to the mysterious world of C syntax parsing!

#include <stdio.h>

void parse(char *code) {
    // Do some complex parsing here
    // Trust me, you won't understand what's going on
    // But it works!
}

int main() {
    char code[] = "int main() { printf(\"Hello World!\\n\"); return 0; }";

    // Let's parse this code
    parse(code);

    // Wait, nothing happened?
    // That's because this is just an example program
    // The real parsing happens in another dimension

    // Meanwhile, let's print out some random characters
    printf("3@t/*&/4:]^:/?.>,{P\n");

    // Congratulations! You have successfully run a program that does nothing.
    // You have unlocked the secret of C syntax parsing!
