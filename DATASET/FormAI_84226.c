The computer was taking an awfully long time to boot up. This was highly unusual considering I had a state-of-the-art system. It was as if something bogged down my computer, leaving it struggling to get to its feet. Before I knew it, I was already engrossed in solving this mystery. 'The game is afoot,' I said to myself, and I was already in my thinking cap.\n\n");

    printf("And thus, the mystery of the slow boot had been solved. I leaned back in my chair, taking in a breath of satisfaction. The system may be complex, but with the knowledge of C System and a little bit of tending, even the most intricate of issues can be resolved.\n");
