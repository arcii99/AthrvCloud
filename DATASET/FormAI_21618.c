// Here is an example of how you could define a structure for a connection.

struct Connection {
  int socket_fd;     // Socket file descriptor
  char *ip_address;  // IP address of the client
  int port;          // Port number of the client
  // additional connection metadata if needed
};

// Define other constants and variables here.

int main() {
  // Initialize the firewall rules and policies.
  // Create the server socket and listen for incoming connections.
  // Set up the select system call to handle multiple clients simultaneously.
  // Add new connections to the active connections list and remove closed connections.
  // Read incoming network traffic using the appropriate socket functions.
  // Apply the firewall rules to incoming and outgoing network traffic.
  // Transmit filtered traffic back to the clients.
  // Handle errors and unexpected events appropriately.
