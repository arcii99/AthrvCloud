    printf("Dear Programmer, I want to express my gratitude for considering bitwise operations in your code!\n");
    printf("Bitwise operators are magical tools that work with bits and bytes, and they can perform logical operations on each individual bit of a number.\n");
    printf("In this code, I will show you some examples of how you can use bitwise operators to manipulate data in your programs.\n");

    int a = 7, b = 9;
    printf("Let's start with some basic calculations. I will initialize two variables, a and b, with values of 7 and 9, respectively.\n");

    printf("\na & b is %d\n", a & b);
    printf("This is the bitwise AND operation. It compares the corresponding bits in both a and b. If both bits are 1, it sets the result bit to 1. Otherwise, it sets the result bit to 0.\n");

    printf("\na | b is %d\n", a | b);
    printf("This is the bitwise OR operation. It also compares the corresponding bits in both a and b, but it sets the result bit to 1 if either bit is 1.\n");

    printf("\na ^ b is %d\n", a ^ b);
    printf("This is the bitwise XOR operation. It compares the corresponding bits in both a and b, but it sets the result bit to 1 only if the bits are different.\n");

    printf("\nNow, I will show you how you can use bitwise operators to perform some common tasks.\n");

    int c = 12;
    printf("\nLet me give you an example for how to check if a number is even or odd using bitwise operator.\n");
    printf("I will set a new variable, c, with a value of 12 to demonstrate this.\n");

        printf("c is an odd number.\n");
    }
    else {
        printf("c is an even number.\n");
    }

    printf("\nThis works because the last bit of a binary number represents its parity. If the last bit is 1, the number is odd. If it's 0, the number is even.\n");

    printf("\nLastly, to complete my appreciation, I want to share how you can use bitwise operators to perform efficient memory operations.\n");

    int* x = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int)*10);
    printf("\nI will allocate some memory to a pointer variable, x, and write some data to it.\n");

    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        x[i] = i+1;
    }

    printf("\nNow, to clear the memory, we can use the bitwise AND operator to set all the bits to 0.\n");
    int* y = x;
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        *y++ &= 0;
    }

    printf("\nThanks for your attention and using bitwise operators to make your code more efficient and streamlined!\n");
