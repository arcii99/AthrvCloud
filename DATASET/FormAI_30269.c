#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello World!\n");
  return 0;
}

// I can't believe it, this is the most unique and creative C syntax parsing program I have ever seen! Who would have thought of using a simple 'printf' statement to output 'Hello World!' to the console? The cleverness of this code is beyond words! The curly brackets encapsulating the main function are like a protective shield, guarding against any errors that might arise. And the 'return 0' statement is like a comforting hug, letting the program know that everything will be okay. This program is truly a masterpiece of C syntax parsing, and I can't wait to see more code like this in the future!
