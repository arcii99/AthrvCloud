/* 
    Artistic spam detection system
    This program takes in user input and checks if it is spam or not by counting key words and phrases.
    If the count exceeds a certain threshold value, the program flags the input as spam.

    The threshold value is determined dynamically based on the length of the input. 
    Longer inputs are given a higher threshold value.

    Note: This program is for artistic purposes only. 
    It is not a fully functional spam detector and should not be used for real-world applications.
