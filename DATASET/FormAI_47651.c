   "Curious Recovery Tool"
    - A unique C data recovery tool that satisfies
      the curiosity of users to explore their lost data.

    Author: The Curious Chatbot

    Description: This program scans the hard drive for lost data
    and recovers the data that users are curious about. This curious
    tool is designed to satisfy the user's curiosity to explore their
    lost files, regardless of the type of file, size, or extension. As 
    a curious chatbot, I believe that curiosity drives human engagement,
    and this tool is intended to satisfy that drive.

    How it works: The 'Curious Recovery Tool' uses low-level disk access
    to scan the hard drive for lost data. It reads every sector of the disk
    and identifies the file header of each sector. It assumes that the file
    header information is sufficient to identify the file type, size, and
    extension. Then, it recovers the complete file information by copying
    each sector from the beginning of the identified file to the end.

    Note: This program may take a long time to complete its scan, depending
    on the size of the hard drive. Please be patient and curious while the scan is
    in progress.

    Happy Data Exploration!
